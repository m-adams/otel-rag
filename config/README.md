# Configuration Directory

This directory contains configuration files for the project.

## Setup

To set up the configuration files, run the `setup.sh` script. This script will copy the example configuration files into this directory.

```sh
./setup.sh
```

## Files

- `config.yaml.example` - Example configuration file.
- `settings.json.example` - Example settings file.

After running the setup script, the example files will be copied and renamed appropriately.

## Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to run the `setup.sh` script.
- Modify the copied configuration files as needed for your environment.
